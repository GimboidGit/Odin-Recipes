            Add a sticky honey and mustard glaze to gammon for a delicious sweetness that 
            contrasts with the saltiness of the meat. It's great for a celebration supper.

            <li>1 celery stick, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbsp black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 tsp cloves</li>

            <li>
                For the Glaze:
            <ul>
                <li>1½ tbsp English mustard</li>
                <li>70g clear honey</li>
                <li>2 tbsp soft dark brown sugar</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Put the gammon in a large, deep saucepan. 
                Add the tied herbs, onion, carrots, celery, peppercorns and cloves. 
                Pour over enough cold water to cover the meat, then bring to the boil, cover with a lid, and lower to a gentle simmer for 1 hr 15 mins. 
                Turn off the heat and leave the ham to sit in the liquid for 30 mins
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the liquid (this makes a delicious soup stock) and leave to cool until cold enough to handle. 
                Peel off the thick layer of skin on the gammon to reveal a layer of fat. 
                Discard the skin and score the fat in a criss-cross pattern with a sharp knife
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the ham in a roasting tray lined with foil. 
                Mix together the mustard, honey and sugar in a bowl, then generously brush half over the ham. 
                Roast for 15 mins, then brush with the remaining glaze. 
                Return to the oven for a further 20-30 mins or until sticky and brown. Leave to cool for 15 mins before carving into thick slices.
