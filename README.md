The Odin Project - Recipes Project

This is repository for the "Recipes" Project from The Odin Project (TOP).

The goal is to create a simple website, where the Home page provides several links to a Food Recipes.

Initial development is focused on the structure of the site.
Once established, the goal of later TOP Projects is to update and "polish" this Recipe project.


Project Stage: basic HTML implementation.
